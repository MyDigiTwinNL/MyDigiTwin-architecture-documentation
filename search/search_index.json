The \u201cDigital Twin\u201d can also be modified for input variables to allow the user to simulate the effect of changes (e.g. in Lifestyle) and assess benefits or harm. The MyDigiTwin platform will also make AI tools available to the users to \u201ccheck\u201d whether their personal data, including possible pharmacotherapy, is in line with the official recommendations from professional cardiovascular practice guidelines. Dedicated research will be directed to obtain fundamental insights into the readiness of society to optimally align the foreseen platform and cockpit (user interface) with the needs and expectations of users. A co-creation strategy will be used to develop MyDigiTwin and its efficacy, in order to empower patients and enable shared decision-making.

By providing accurate and reliable information, individuals can take action much faster, in the early stages of the diseases, and reduce the severity of potential consequences. . Q2 Privacy The motivation behind privacy is to ensure that end-users trust is not violated and that users can maintain control over their data. Maintaining privacy is crucial in the MyDigiTwin project as it deals with collecting and storing sensitive health data of end-users. Q3 Security The security motivation is to safeguard the trust of the end-users in the project and enable them to share their sensitive health data confidently. By doing so, the project aims to enhance the amount of available data that can be used to train the predictive models and promote innovative research in detecting heart diseases. Q4 Usability Usability aims at improving the end-user application accessibility and usability for a broad range of citizen end-users, in particular that it ensure that the app's visuals and structures fit the needs of functionally illiterate people. Q5 Safety The primary motivation for safety is to protect the well-being of patients who rely on the accuracy and reliability of the heart risk predictions provided by the software.

System context","text":"<p>MyDigiTwin is a scientific endeavor led by a consortium comprised of scientific and commercial partners within the health domain. Consequently, MyDigiTwin as a technological product has two fundamental 'embodiments' given each partner's main viewpoint: a patient-oriented user-friendly product to be integrated into PGOs' infrastructure, and a research environment where scientists can develop the AI-based back-bone of the said product, that is to say, CVD prediction models.</p> <p>These prediction models are expected to be created from multiple big-data reference datasets combined, which would be included in this research environment as they become available. Given all the above -as described in the diagram below- in addition to the researchers and the patients, the system will involve developers, domain experts, and data experts who will work on the integration of these reference datasets. In particular, they are expected to work on tasks such as data harmonization, infrastructure configuration, and model tuning (e.g.,. for multi-data statistical homogeneity).</p> <p></p> <p>Also according to the diagram, it is important to highlight that there won't be any kind of application-level interoperability between the end-user environment (which would be eventually deployed on multiple PGOs) and the research one. Instead, the PGOs will get access to the prediction models trained in the research environment, once the researchers have validated them. This improves privacy (for PGOs data and reference datasets) by ensuring that there won't be an exchange of patient information outside of the PGO environment. Furthermore, avoiding direct interoperability between the MyDigiTwin module, and the research infrastructure, would also prevent scalability and computing-power costs issues with the reference datasets infrastructure (which are often limited as they are intended for research purposes only). This is due to the fact that this module would be eventually running on multiple PGOs, where each one, in turn, would be handling concurrent simulation or prediction requests from many patients.</p>"},{"location":"05.Building%20Block%20View/#l2-research-environment","title":"L2.

With this motivation, the core element of the research environment is a privacy-preserving federated learning architecture. This architecture (also referred to as Personal Health Train, or PHT, in the health care domain) allows multiple parties to collaboratively train models, or perform data analysis, without sharing raw data. Instead, each party performs local computations and updates on their data, and the model updates are shared with one that aggregates them into a global model.</p> <p>As illustrated in the diagram below, each reference dataset would be part of the federated learning architecture as a node. Each node, based on a request sent by the central server (e.g., an algorithm), will locally train a machine learning model using its respective data, and return only model updates or aggregated information. The central server, in turn, will aggregate and update a global model.

Harmonizing the data involves standardizing these differences to ensure compatibility and consistency, facilitating effective model training across all nodes.</p> <p>Given that the research environment of MyDigiTwin is expected to integrate more reference datasets over time, the harmonization strategy for its federating architecture is to make said datasets FHIR-compliant. This way, the federated algorithms could refer to variables within a reference dataset in a standardized fashion by using FHIRPath -the language for querying and navigating FHIR resources-.</p> <p>As illustrated in the diagram above, it is then expected that each node will have a local copy of its corresponding dataset represented (transformed) as FHIR resources -a FHIR bundle for each data point-. More specifically, these FHIR resources would be compliant with the Zib-profile (2017) published by MedMij. </p> <p>To make this harmonization process as consistent as possible across multiple reference datasets, several tools are developed as part of MyDigiTwin.

Research environment components","text":"<p>For the implementation of the research environment, vantage6 provides a flexible infrastructure for its underlying federated learning architecture. Vantage6 is an open-source platform inspired by the Personal Health Train (PHT) concept, which stands for privacy-preserving federated learning infrastructure for secure insight exchange. It is built on three fundamental principles: Autonomy, Heterogeneity, and Flexibility. Autonomy ensures that all parties involved in the federated learning process remain independent and autonomous. Heterogeneity allows parties to have differences in hardware and operating systems. Flexibility refers to how the platform does not impose restrictions on the data that can be used for training models.</p> <p></p> <p>The server is the central component of the vantage6 architecture. It stores information about organizations, users, and other aspects of pre-arranged collaborations for a particular training or data analytics process.  and nodes to authenticate and interact through the API that it hosts.

It is responsible for locally executing computation tasks (e.g., local training) and returning the results to the server. </p> <p>The diagram above illustrates how vantage6 would handle a request to execute an algorithm within a collaboration (an agreement between two or more parties to participate in a study). For the sake of simplicity, This algorithm only involves two nodes: 'Organization A', and 'Aggregator'. The former, is expected to process its local dataset, whereas the latter would simply aggregate partial results from other nodes:</p> <p><pre><code>central_algorithm()\n    results_a = run(intermediate_algorithm,Organization-A)\n    aggregate(results_a, central_model)\n</code></pre> <pre><code>intermediate_algorithm()\n    results = local_training(local_dataset)\n    post_result(results)\n</code></pre></p> <p>The above algorithms Central_algorithm and Intermediate_algorithm (presented in pseudo-code for simplicity), are expected to be executed as follows:</p> <ol> <li>A server client (e.g., a researcher) requests the execution of central_algorithm on the 'Aggregator node'.</li> <li>The server will notify the 'Aggregator node' about this new task.</li> <li>The 'Aggregator node' pulls the algorithm from a container registry.</li> <li>As described on the pseudo-code, once executed, central_algorithm, will request the server to run the 'intermediate_algorithm' on Organization-A's node.</li> <li>The server, in turn, will notify 'Organization A' about the request for running the the'intermediate_algorithm'.</li> <li>Organization-A also pulls the said algorithm from the container registry.</li> <li>The intermediate_algorithm algorithm processes the data it has access to.</li> <li>The intermediate_algorithm sends aggregated data, to the aggregator, through the server.</li> <li>The server posts the partial results to the Aggregator node.</li> <li>The aggregator node uses the partial results from Organization A, and from other nodes (not described in these steps), to create a unified, central model. </li> </ol> <p>The steps above do not mention many security considerations involved in the process (these are addressed in the Risks section).

The selection of which approach to follow would depend on the agreements between the involved parties and the desired machine learning or data analysis application. Differential privacy v6 node-infrastructure admin, algorithm developer DP-noise should be added to the data after it is harmonized before enabling access to it to any algorithm (to ensure data points cannot be exposed during local analysis). To prevent gradients leakage, on the other hand, the federated algorithm running on the node, should add DP-noise to the model updates to be sent to the server and to the aggregator. The v6 node-infrastructure admin is responsible for checking these practices within the algorithms before enabling them on the policies configuration file. Secure communication protocols v6-node admin, v6-server admin To prevent eavesdropping attacks, the first measures involve the server admin enabling the use of vantage6 REST API through HTTPS (See #3 in the diagrams). This ensures secure communication between the server and clients by encrypting the data transmitted over the network. Additionally, digital certificates should be used to authenticate the server's identity. Furthermore, to prevent a potential attacker within the vantage6 server (See #4) to get partial or aggregated results from the data sent between users(researchers) and nodes, all the nodes should enable v6's  AES end-to-end encryption feature. HME node infrastrucrure admins, vantage6 node installer The end-to-end encryption features previously described would prevent an attacker to get partial results or aggregated data, even if they get access to the v6-server. However, in a federated learning algorithm the aggregator node would still get access to these unencrypted individual pieces of data. This makes this party prone, for example, to membership inference attacks. As homomorphic encryption allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it, it could be used when the aggregator node is not a trusted party, or, in general, when inference attacks want to be prevented on the aggregator. Backdoor attacks, particularly the ones based on the injection of malicious model updates (through data or model poisoning -see #5), would also be mitigated with HME. This kind of attacks need very specific model updates to make the global model to behave in the way desired by the adversary, which wouldn't make it to the final model as these would be encrypted. To this end, the algorithms should be created in a way that each party encrypts its model updates using homomorphic encryption techniques. Robust Aggregation Algorithms Algorithm developer When used as part of the federated learning strategy, non-robust aggregation algorithms would allow updates that significantly deviate from the real ones, introducing significant error on the global model, e.g., through model poisoning (see #2) or data poisoning (see #1). Algorithm developer should include a robust aggregation algorithm that mitigates poisoning attacks, for example, by considering only the most representative model updates (e.g., byzantine-robust aggregation methods).
