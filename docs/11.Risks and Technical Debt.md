Risks and Technical Debts 
=========================

## Risks

In this section, we identify potential risks and threats to the MyDigiTwin project using the STRIDE model. The STRIDE model helps to categorize risks based on different types of security threats: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege.

### 11.1 Spoofing

| **Risk** | **Mitigation** |
| --- | --- |
| | |

### 11.2 Tampering

| **Risk** | **Mitigation** |
| --- | --- |
| | |

### 11.3 Repudiation

| **Risk** | **Mitigation** |
| --- | --- |
| | |

### 11.4 Information Disclosure

| **Risk** | **Mitigation** |
| --- | --- |
| | |

### 11.5 Denial of Service

| **Risk** | **Mitigation** |
| --- | --- |
| | |

### 11.6 Elevation of Privilege

| **Risk** | **Mitigation** |
| --- | --- |
| | |


## Technical debts

In this section, we identify technical debts present in the MyDigiTwin project. Technical debt refers to areas in the project where compromises or shortcuts were made during development that may require future refactoring or improvement. It is essential to track and address technical debts to ensure the long-term maintainability and scalability of the system.
