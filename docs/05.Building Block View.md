## Level 1 building blocks

MyDigiTwin, as a software system, will exist in two separate (yet related) contexts: (1) the end-user one, that is to say, the product that will be deployed on multiple [PGOs](./12.Glossary.md), and (2) the research environment for the creation of the prediction models used in the said end-user context. The following ellaborates on both.

### End user context

MyDigiTwin is envisioned as a platform that could be integrated into a PGO platform to provide prediction, simulation, and guidelines verification services. Technically, this could be achieved by deploying MyDigiTwin as an API on its own infrastructure, so that any PGO can perform this integration by using this API remotely. 

However, this approach has the following drawbacks:
*	It would require exchanging the patient’s information (e.g., as the input for a prediction model) between the PGO and the said API. This means opening a weak spot for potential data breaches to take care of.
*	It is not clear on which premises this would be running, and who would be accountable for the computation costs. This is important particularly given that these services would be eventually used by multiple PGOs, and hence, by potentially thousands of patients concurrently.

Given the above, a better approach would be to distribute MyDigiTwin as a ‘containerized’ application image, that can be deployed within each PGO’s premises, along with copies of the prediction models, as depicted in the following diagram.

This approach, on the one hand, is safer as it would not require the exchange of patient information outside of the PGO environment. On the other, the computation costs of the services and the use of the pre-trained models would be covered by  PGO.


### Research context

The Research context (light green in the figure below), deals with the computational artifacts and infrastructure to train, evaluate, compare, and release prediction and validation models (which would be later used by the PGOs) from the available reference datasets and professional guidelines. Considering privacy-preserving concerns, the training process would follow a federated approach, that is to say, the data used for training would remain decentralized and distributed across multiple local sources or devices, and the model would be trained collaboratively without requiring the raw data to leave those sources or devices. This approach ensures that individual data privacy is protected while still enabling the model to learn from multiple reference datasets without centralizing them in one location.
