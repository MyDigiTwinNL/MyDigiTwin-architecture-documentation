Introduction and Goals
======================

MyDigiTwin is a scientific initiative to develop a platform in which individuals can, for the first time, directly compare their personal health data with big-data reference data available from multiple cohorts, including ±200,000 national and ±500,000 international volunteers with long-term follow-up. This big-data will be queried via FAIR data access points and “on the fly” comparison by Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based algorithms will return results that will be used to render a “Digital Twin” (representative) of each individual user. This “Digital Twin” informs the user on the actual observed cardiovascular events of the identified “most alike” volunteers from big-data reference sets. The “Digital Twin” can also be modified for input variables to allow the user to simulate the effect of changes (e.g. in Lifestyle) and assess benefits or harm. The MyDigiTwin platform will also make AI tools available to the users to “check” whether their personal data, including possible pharmacotherapy, is in line with the official recommendations from professional cardiovascular practice guidelines. Dedicated research will be directed to obtain fundamental insights into the readiness of society to optimally align the foreseen platform and cockpit (user interface) with the needs and expectations of users. A co-creation strategy will be used to develop MyDigiTwin and its efficacy, in order to empower patients and enable shared decision-making. This will be tested in a real-life setting by our clinicians. MyDigiTwin contributes to self-management and improved interaction with health care professionals through knowledge-driven empowerment, technical solutions to enhance communication, and reports to simulate shared decision making.


## Goal: Convert consolidated medical data into useful information

Motivation: Convert stored and consolidated medical data into useful information that benefits the owner of the data, i.e., individuals.

## Goal: Make this consolidated medical information esily accessible to individuals

Motivation: The project aims to help individuals who are less educated and belong to migrant, low-skilled and low-literate groups of people getting access to consolidated medical information.

Quality Goals
-------------

| Number | Quality                 | Motivation                     |
|--------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Q1     | Accuracy | High accuracy in detecting heart diseases is essential for the MyDigiTwin project since it aims to empower individuals to investigate their health status and respond quickly by seeking professional healthcare. By providing accurate and reliable information, individuals can take action much faster, in the early stages of the diseases, and reduce the severity of potential consequences. .                                                  |
| Q2     | Privacy             | The motivation behind privacy is to ensure that end-users trust is not violated and that users can maintain control over their data. Maintaining privacy is crucial in the MyDigiTwin project as it deals with collecting and storing sensitive health data of end-users.                        |
| Q3     | Security             | The security motivation is to safeguard the trust of the end-users in the project and enable them to share their sensitive health data confidently. By doing so, the project aims to enhance the amount of available data that can be used to train the predictive models and promote innovative research in detecting heart diseases.                   |
| Q4     | Usability         | Usability aims at improving the end-user application accessibility and usability for a broad range of citizen end-users, in particular that it ensure that the app's visuals and structures fit the needs of functionally illiterate people.               |
| Q5     | Safety                | The primary motivation for safety is to protect the well-being of patients who rely on the accuracy and reliability of the heart risk predictions provided by the software.  Furthermore, Ensuring the safety of the software is essential to maintain the integrity of these medical decisions and to provide healthcare professionals with reliable information.|
